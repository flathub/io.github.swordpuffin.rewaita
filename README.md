# 🐛 Known Bugs
#### Gnome Shell theme is not generating:
1. Power off your computer (like full shutdown, not restart).
2. Turn it back on and try again.
3. If it still doesn't generate:
     1. Go into [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) and find Rewaita's page
     2. Scroll down to filesystem permissions (you should see ~/.local/share/themes among "other files")
     3. Change ~/.local/share/themes to: ~/.local/share/themes:create (just append ":create")
     4. If it still doesn't work file an issue.

#### Application window opens but is empty:
#### 1. Flatpak
   
Run:
```
rm ~/.var/app/io.github.swordpuffin.rewaita/data/prefs.json
```
#### 2. AUR
See upstream [bug](https://github.com/SwordPuffin/Rewaita/issues/48) 

Install xdg-desktop-portal-gtk with:
```bash
sudo pacman -S xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
```
Then reboot.
